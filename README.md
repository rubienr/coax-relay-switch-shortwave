Shortwave Coax Switch for Antennas
__________________________________
Very simple schema that switches up to four antenna relays.


Example
_______
The system contains of 4 PCBs:

* The input switch box:
  * 1x switch-matrix (ensures only one relay being active)
  * 1x relais-with-led-indicator (keeps the state, has LED indicator)

* The antenna switch box:
  * 1x switch-matrix (ensures only one relay being active)
  * 1x relais-with-led-indicator (keeps the state)

Schema and PCB
______________
* switch-matrix
* relais-with-led-indicator
